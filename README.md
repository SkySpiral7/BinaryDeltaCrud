# Binary Delta CRUD
A [red lang](https://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html) implementation of my [Binary Delta CRUD specification](docs/spec.md).

## Running the app
`cli.red` has all basic functionality. Use `red cli.red help` for a list of functions.
Documentation will be added later if I feel like it.

## Running the tests
Run `scripts/runAllTests.sh` to run all the tests. It expects `scripts/red` to be pointed at a [red binary](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html)
(not included in this repo).

## Compatibility
Project was tested with red-13jan24-4b95ca192 (interpreted only).
