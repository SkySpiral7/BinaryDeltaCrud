* Add my delta spec as a read me in the repo
* Shared Dictionary Compression for HTTP deprecated because VCDIFF (RFC 3284) compression sucked compared to normal ones like GZip
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3284 additionally it's just very different. diff use case at the least
   * https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch sounds like it's using other formats
* patch file? doesn't do binary. you could force it but that only works if your binary happens to not have certain symbols since I don't think there's a way to escape them. even then it's very wasteful
* cmp -l format? wasteful and only does index replace
* https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff didn't tell me what format is used
   * https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette/
   * https://github.com/reproteq/DiffPatchWpf
* xxd etc to convert to hex then text diff: wasteful
* https://github.com/vibhorkalley/jojodiff or https://sourceforge.net/projects/jojodiff/ couldn't find format

use cases
* version control (like git or incremental backups)
* app updates (including mods or synchronizing files between two computers)
